# The-Staircase-of-Ethics-MMDs
 We introduce Multi-step Moral Dilemmas (MMDs), a dataset of 3,302 structured dilemmas, each consisting of five progressively complex scenarios.

This dataset is released along with our EMNLP 2025 Paper entitled *The Staircase of Ethics: Probing LLM Value Priorities through Multi-Step Induction to Complex Moral Dilemmas*
